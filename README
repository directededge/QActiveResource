This is a basic implementation of Ruby's ActiveResource for Qt.  At the moment
it only supports reading, but offers vast speed improvements of Ruby's native
implementation (using Nokogiri or otherwise).

Building requires Qt and libcurl installed and their respective development
headers.

Also included are bindings to make use of these classes from Ruby.  There are
some benchmarks in the "Benchmarks" subdirectory including the results and 
test code / data.  Currently this implementation, when used from inside Ruby,
is about 35x faster than the default ActiveResource implementation.

The code is dual-licensed under the LGPL and MPL.

Enjoy!
